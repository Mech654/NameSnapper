## Firefox(Mozilla) Extension
If you’re a fellow webnovel addict, you know it’s a pain in the arse—and sometimes straight‑up impossible—to keep characters straight.

I mean, how am I supposed to remember that Ching Dong Han Li (one guy, yeah) isn’t Ching Dong Han Lu?

That’s where this extension comes in. It lets you assign colors to names—make the evil brother a dark crimson or let the extension pick a random shade for you.

By marking every name in-color, this extension helps you actually build each sentence in your head—boosting both your reading speed and comprehension quality.

Wanna try it? Link’s coming soon—stay tuned!
