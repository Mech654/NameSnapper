# Icons Needed

This folder should contain the following icon files for the NameSnapper Firefox extension:

- **icon-16.png** - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- **icon-32.png** - 32x32 pixels (toolbar icon retina)
- **icon-48.png** - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- **icon-128.png** - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG with transparency
- Style: Should represent the "NameSnapper" concept (perhaps a name tag, text capture, or similar theme)
- Colors: Should work well on both light and dark backgrounds
- Design: Simple and recognizable at small sizes

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator
- Online icon generators
- AI image generators with prompts like "simple icon for name extraction tool"
- Icon libraries (make sure to check licensing)

## Temporary Solution

Until you create proper icons, you can:
1. Use placeholder icons from online icon libraries
2. Create simple colored squares with "NS" text
3. Use existing icons from your system (convert to PNG if needed)

The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience significantly.
